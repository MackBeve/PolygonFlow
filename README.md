Polygon Flow

J. Mack Beveridge

This is a small python program I made for a math research project in Summer 2016.  It models a few different geometric polygoon flows that we were studying.

Requirements:
-matplotlib
-numpy

Instructions:
1. Run polyflow.py
2. The program will prompt you to choose aeither a randomly generated polygon or to create your own
3. Choose the nuber of vertices
4. If you are making your own polygon, enter the x and y coordinates
5. Pick which flow you want to model
6. An animation of the polygon flowing will appear and continue until the window is closed
7. A plot of the isopermetric ratio of the polygon over time will appear
